          You opened the door to a new life for Jennifer and her seven-year-old daughter, Adora. You made the impossible possible for Jennifer’s family, 
        </p>
        <p>
          When Jennifer first moved into Franciscan Towers, she was in disbelief. After experiencing homelessness on and off for seven years, the idea of having a stable home where she could care for both her daughter and their new kitty seemed unimaginable.

        <p>
          “I still pinch myself every day and say ‘Is this real? Is this real?’” said Jennifer Black, a resident of Franciscan Towers for the last three years.

          Your support gave Jennifer the life she always wanted for her family. Now, she can work and bring Adora to regular doctor appointments, help her with homework, and attend her own weekly therapy sessions.

          “It’s everything I wanted. Everything that I ever wanted was to be able to support her and take care of her and help her with school,” said Jennifer, “and I’m doing it.”

          Not long ago, Jennifer lived a very different reality, where it was impossible to care for herself and her daughter the way she wanted. After leaving an abusive household, Jennifer had to navigate a network of supportive shelters in the Tenderloin.

        <p>
          Her daily life involved calling shelter after shelter to find an available bed. If Compass was full, she would call Glide. If Glide was full, she would call Providence. And so on.

          The lack of stability meant Jennifer kept all her belongings in a storage space. What she carried with her she had to protect at all times. “Basically I had a stroller and that was it. We went from shelter to shelter, from place to place, until we actually found here,” remembered Jennifer. It was impossible to relax, to trust others, even to do something as simple as buy and store food for the next day.

        <p>
          Because you are fighting to end homelessness in San Francisco, Jennifer and Adora found a home.  Because you believe in supportive communities, Jennifer has people in her home that are restoring her trust and securing Adora’s bright future.

          Thank you for opening the door for people to change their lives and legacies.
